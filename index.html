    <div class="message">Hi Air, you said I couldn't do it yeah? Air is a fascinating speciment on earth, air is so stupid and cant comprehnd anything... Picture a creature so devoid of intellect, it makes a rock look like a genius. Air is like that distant cousin at family gatherings who always manages to say the wrong thing at the wrong time, except Air does it 24/7. This creature's thought process is about as clear as mud. It's like trying to explain quantum physics to a goldfish. You could tell Air the sky is blue, and it would probably argue that it's polka-dotted. But let's not be too harsh on Air; after all, it's not its fault that its brain cells seem to be on an extended vacation. In a world of thinkers, Air is the ultimate nonconformist, a rebel against logic and reason. Despite its intellectual challenges, Air has a certain charm. Maybe it's the way it bumbles through life, blissfully unaware of its own absurdity. Or perhaps it's the fact that no matter how bad your day is, spending time with Air is guaranteed to make you feel like a genius in comparison. So, here's to Air, the reigning champion of the dim-witted, the undisputed king of cluelessness. Long may it reign, in all its glory.</div>
